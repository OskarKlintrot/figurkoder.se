# Brief description of changes

# Longer description if needed
# - What was changed
# - Why it was changed
# - Any important details

# REMINDER: Did you run `npm run format` before committing?
# All code must be properly formatted to pass CI checks.

# Please follow conventional commit format when possible:
# feat: add new feature
# fix: bug fix
# docs: documentation changes
# style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc.
# refactor: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# test: adding missing tests
# chore: maintain
