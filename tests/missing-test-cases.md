# Test Cases Documentation

This document previously contained comprehensive test cases for the Figurkoder.se PWA that were missing from the test suite. All test cases identified in this document have now been **successfully implemented** in the test suite.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All missing test cases have been implemented with the following test files:

### High Priority Tests (Implemented ✅)

- **Game State Management Tests** → `tests/game/game-state-management.spec.js`
- **Show Answer ("VISA") Functionality Tests** → `tests/game/show-answer-functionality.spec.js`
- **Navigation and Back Button Tests** → `tests/game/navigation-back-button.spec.js`

### Medium Priority Tests (Implemented ✅)

- **Progress Bar and UI State Tests** → `tests/game/progress-bar-ui-state.spec.js`
- **Data Range and Input Validation Tests** → `tests/game/data-range-input-validation.spec.js`
- **Results and Performance Tracking Tests** → `tests/game/results-performance-tracking.spec.js`
- **PWA and Offline Functionality Tests** → `tests/game/pwa-offline-functionality.spec.js`

### Lower Priority Tests (Implemented ✅)

- **Vibration and Device Integration Tests** → `tests/game/vibration-device-integration.spec.js`
- **Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation Tests** → `tests/game/accessibility-keyboard-navigation.spec.js`
- **Performance and Memory Tests** → `tests/game/performance-memory.spec.js`
- **Cross-Browser and Responsive Tests** → `tests/game/cross-browser-responsive.spec.js`

## Test Coverage Summary

**Total Test Files Created**: 11  
**Total Test Cases Implemented**: 39+  
**All Priority Levels**: ✅ Complete

### Key Features Covered

- ✅ Complex state transitions and mode switching
- ✅ Answer visibility and VISA button functionality
- ✅ Navigation context and back button behavior
- ✅ Progress bar stability and UI layout
- ✅ Input validation and data filtering
- ✅ Results tracking and performance monitoring
- ✅ PWA features and offline functionality
- ✅ Device integration and graceful degradation
- ✅ Accessibility and keyboard navigation
- ✅ Memory management and performance monitoring
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility and responsive design

### Test Implementation Notes

- All tests follow existing naming conventions (descriptive names starting with "should")
- Tests include comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- All tests properly formatted with Prettier
- Tests cover historical bugs and edge cases identified in git history
- Implementation provides robust coverage for PWA functionality across all platforms

## Next Steps

With all missing test cases now implemented, the focus should be on:

1. **Running the complete test suite** to ensure all tests pass
2. **Integrating tests into CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing
3. **Monitoring test results** and maintaining test quality over time
4. **Adding new tests** as new features are developed
